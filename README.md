# squatAnalysis
Biomechanical analysis of squat correct execution with the use of OpenSim.
Analysis conducted as a part of intermediate engineering project. The principal objective of this work was to 
investigate the additional loads on lower limb's joints created by inappropriate squat techique. Model used in 
the project was made by Apoorva Rajagopal (Rajagopal, Apoorva, et al. "Full-Body Musculoskeletal Model for Muscle-Driven Simulation of Human Gait." 
IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering 63.10 (2016): 2068-2079. (2016)).
